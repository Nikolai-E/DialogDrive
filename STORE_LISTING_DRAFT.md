# Store Listing Draft

## Proposed Name
DialogDrive - AI Prompt & Chat Workspace

## Short Description (<=132 chars)
Capture, organize, search, and paste AI prompts & chat bookmarks for ChatGPT. 100% local. No tracking.

## Long Description
DialogDrive is a focused productivity extension that centralizes your AI prompt workflow and chat session bookmarks for ChatGPT. Stop hunting through scattered notes-capture, organize, and reuse everything instantly.

### Key Features
- Unified library for prompts & chat bookmarks
- Workspaces, tags, pinning, and fast search
- Keyboard shortcuts for paste & capture
- Context menu: save selection, paste latest prompt
- Side panel + popup views with dense, fast UI
- Usage tracking (local only) to surface your most valuable prompts
- Privacy-first design: no external servers, no analytics

### How It Works
1. Save prompts or capture chats from supported AI sites
2. Organize with workspaces and tags
3. Pin or search to retrieve instantly
4. Paste the latest or selected prompt directly into active chat inputs

### Privacy & Data
All data (prompts, bookmarks, usage counts, settings) stays on your device. No cloud sync, no tracking pixels, no third-party analytics. Host permissions are limited strictly to required AI domains to enable paste and capture actions.

### Permissions Justification
- storage: Persist your library
- tabs: Identify the active tab for messages
- clipboardWrite: Provide fallback paste behavior
- contextMenus: Right-click capture & paste
- notifications: Confirm save actions
- sidePanel: Persistent workspace view
- Specific host permissions: ChatGPT only

### Why DialogDrive?
- Minimal, fast, unobtrusive
- Designed for high-volume AI users
- Aggressive UI density for small popup footprint
- Open structure for future local-only enhancements

### Roadmap (Non-Intrusive)
