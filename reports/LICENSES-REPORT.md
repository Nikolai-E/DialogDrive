# DialogDrive License Compliance Report

**Verdict:** Safe to publish under PolyForm Noncommercial â€“ **Yes** (no copyleft or share-alike obligations in the shipped bundle).  
**Blockers:** None identified.  
**Remediations:**  
- [ ] Add explicit CC-BY-4.0 attribution for `caniuse-lite` wherever notices accompany the PolyForm license.  
- [ ] Document ownership (or upstream license) for the DialogDrive icon set and marketing screenshots/videos before release.  
- [ ] Keep MPL-2.0 dev tooling (`fx-runner`, `web-ext-run`) strictly out of distributed artifacts.  
**Residual obligations:** Include MIT/Apache/ISC license notices, CC-BY attribution text, and retain this report (plus `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`) with release documentation.

## Additional observations

- **Bundling model:** `wxt` (Vite-based) statically bundles runtime dependencies into the extension. Because all shipped code is permissively licensed (MIT/ISC/Apache), bundling is compatible with PolyForm Noncommercial. Continue to avoid adding GPL/AGPL/LGPL dependencies, as they would become blockers once bundled.
- **Development-only packages:** `fx-runner` and `web-ext-run` are MPL-2.0, but remain outside the distributed Chrome package (`dist/` or `.output`). No modifications were detected; if you ever redistribute tooling binaries, include MPL notices and make modified sources available.
- **SPDX headers:** No `SPDX-License-Identifier` headers were found in project sources. This is optional, but adding a top-level license file (PolyForm Noncommercial once adopted) plus per-file headers for new files can help future audits.
- **Automated data collection:** `npm ls --all --json` succeeded (`reports/npm-tree.json`). Network restrictions blocked `cyclonedx-npm` and third-party license scanners; `reports/license-checker.json` (custom generated) captures equivalent metadata from installed packages.
- **Assets:** Only first-party imagery and videos ship with the extension/website. Playwright-generated assets stay in developer reports; ensure those directories are excluded from packaged builds.

## Packaging / distribution review

- Chrome extension builds (`wxt build` / `wxt zip`) package bundled code plus the `public/icon` assets. No `node_modules` or dev/test artifacts are copied, mitigating risk from MPL or GPL-optional tooling.
- The marketing site (`website/`) is static and references only first-party assets; confirm hosting complies with CC-BY attribution obligations (add credit in footer or notices page).
- No modified third-party files were detected. If you fork any MPL/Apache packages in future, document the changes and expected notice updates in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.

## Recommended follow-up

1. Add CC-BY-4.0 attribution (for `caniuse-lite`) to the README, marketing site footer, or extension about dialog.
2. Capture explicit provenance for the DialogDrive icon/screenshot/video assets (e.g., include a short statement in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` or separate `ASSETS-INVENTORY.md` footnotes).
3. When migrating to PolyForm Noncommercial, add the PolyForm license file at repo root and reference it in package metadata.
