BLOCK

- Top blockers:
  - TODO 1: Floating save modal allows unsanitized HTML, violating MV3 security expectations.
  - TODO 2: Manifest CSP lacks default/connect restrictions, leaving remote loads possible.
  - TODO 3: No user-facing clear-all data control, so privacy deletion promise is unfulfilled.
- Launch conditions: Resolve TODOs 1-3, refresh privacy policy (TODO 5), and rerun the expanded QA/security checks (TODO 7).
- Post-launch monitoring: Verify no background errors in chrome://extensions, monitor support channels for data deletion issues, and schedule quarterly policy/compliance reviews.
